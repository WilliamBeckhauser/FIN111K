FIN111K: Classified Financial News Dataset

Financial news has a significant impact on stock prices, both in the present and in the future, often serving as the primary guide for small-scale investments. In our research, we have observed that the currently available datasets are becoming small and outdated. Consequently, in this study, we introduce the FIN111K dataset, consisting of over 111,704 financial news articles in English. These news articles were collected through web scraping from prominent financial publications such as The Economist, Financial Times, and Investors Chronicle. The data underwent a cleaning and structuring process, after which 5,000 news articles were categorized into three levels of impact on the financial market: weak, semi-strong, and strong, using the GPT-3.5 model. The classified data were used to train a BERT model, which was then employed to classify the rest of the dataset, achieving a 74\% F1 Score. The dataset we have developed has potential applications in chatbots, trend analysis, and utilization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
